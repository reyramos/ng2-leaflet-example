  Force full width & height.

  If this block is removed, the layout height/length will be determined by
  the amount of content in the page. That might result in a page which has
  a footer only a few inches from the top of the viewport, or one which
  scrolls beyond the viewport.

  This forces the layout to always be full screen regardless of how much,
  or how little, content is in place. Neither is "right" or "wrong", there
  are valid cases for each. I just want to be clear what's controlling the
  page/viewport height.
